<p>This is a common issue when using the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag in HTML. The issue arises when the <code>src</code> attribute points to a URL that either doesn't exist or is inaccessible due to network issues, security restrictions (CORS), or incorrect addressing.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;iframe src="https://example.com/invalid-page.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre><p>This can result in a blank space where the iframe should be, or it might cause layout issues on the webpage.</p>
