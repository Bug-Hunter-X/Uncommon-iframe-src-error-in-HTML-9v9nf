# Uncommon iframe src error in HTML

This repository demonstrates a scenario where an iframe tag in HTML might cause unexpected behavior.  The problem arises when the `src` attribute of the iframe points to an invalid or inaccessible URL. This leads to the iframe either not loading at all or displaying a blank space while possibly causing layout problems in the parent page.

The `bug.html` file contains the faulty code, and `bugSolution.html` offers a corrected version.

## Bug Description

An iframe is expected to display content from a specified URL. However, if the URL is wrong or inaccessible (due to CORS, network issues, or simply not existing), it could result in a blank space where the iframe should render. This can lead to unexpected visual glitches and layout issues in the main webpage.

## Solution

Ensure that the `src` attribute correctly points to a valid and accessible URL.  Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage situations where the iframe cannot load its content (this could involve providing a fallback mechanism for display or logging an error message).
